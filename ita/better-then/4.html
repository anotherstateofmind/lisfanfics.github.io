<p>I’m watching a laptop screen. On the other side there is a small room, and inside the room is a plain metal slab, and strapped to the slab is Chloe. She’s out of sorts and disheveled, her shirt is a torn rag on the floor. Next to Chloe stands a young woman holding a knife in her hand, and the blade is red with blood.</p>

<p>By my shackled wrist there is a small table with a phone on it. A voice, deep yet slightly nasal, comes through to smugly chastise me.</p>

<p>“You disappoint me, Miss Caulfield. You have told another lie. Miss Derrick?”</p>

<p>“No,” I beg him, “I swear, no, no, please, stop hurting her, please, I’ll do everything you want, I swear...”</p>

<p>“One line for every lie.”</p>

<p>The knife cuts into her, drawing another line of red. Chloe’s screams curdle my soul. She tries to hold them in, but she can’t. I would do anything, <em>anything </em>to stop them.</p>

<p>“Please, please, I swear...I swear I’m done fighting...”</p>

<p>“Will you take any further action against me?”</p>

<p>“No, I swear, I swear it...”</p>

<p>“You continue lying to me, Miss Caulfield.”</p>

<p>“No! Please! You win, I can’t fight you, I see that now! I’m begging you, <em>please </em>stop, I’ll do anything you ask.”</p>

<p>“One line for every lie, Miss Derrick.”</p>

<p>“Stop! STOP! Don’t touch her, I’ll fucking kill you!”</p>

<p>My wrists are bleeding from fighting the cuffs. I can’t rewind all this away. He <em>knows </em>what I can do and he can stop it<em>. </em>Like in a fever dream I watch Chloe scream and weep and yell profanities at that knife-wielding bitch. They are somewhere far, somewhere I can’t reach. This is what despair feels like.</p>

<p>“Finally something truthful, Miss Caulfield. You have such drive in you, it is a shame you wouldn’t take my generous offer. So unfortunate that we have...crossed the Rubicon now, so to speak. Imagine if you had only listened to reason all along.”</p>

<p>“You fucking asshole...”</p>

<p>“Miss Caulfield, I would appreciate it if you watched your language. I will not ask again.”</p>

<p>“...Sorry. I’m sorry. Look, I surrender, okay? You made your point, you won, I’ll do whatever you want. Just stop hurting her...”</p>

<p>“Repeat after me: ‘I’ll do whatever you want, <em>sir.’</em>”</p>

<p>“I...I’ll do whatever you want. Sir.”</p>

<p>“Going back on your word already? I cannot stand being lied to. Miss Derrick?”</p>

<p>“No, no, I’m sorry, please don’t, please!”</p>

<p>Make it stop. I can’t handle it. Make her screams stop.</p>

<p>I have never felt hatred like this.</p>

<p>“Let’s try again, Miss Caulfield.”</p>

<p>“You fucking sack of shit, how can you do this to anyone...”</p>

<p>“You <em>will </em>be disciplined for your language, Miss Caulfield.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me! I’ll work for you, I mean it. I’m helpless and I know it. But I <em>will </em>go after you if you ever give me the chance—and the more you hurt her, the more determined I’ll be to kill you. <em>Nothing </em>you do now can make me feel otherwise. Go ahead and tell me if that’s the goddamn truth.”</p>

<p>There’s a stretch of silence only broken by Chloe’s whimpers.</p>

<p>“It is,” the voice says. “It is indeed. Mr. Jefferson, take her back to the cell and work on her until morning. She is of no use to me this willful.”</p>

<p>A presence looms behind me. “It will be my pleasure.”</p>

<p>The room around me changes, transforming into black and white scenery. Harsh lights, storage boxes, clear backdrop...that infernal couch.</p>

<p>“A time traveler,” Jefferson says. “No wonder I couldn’t keep you to myself. But that’s okay, right Max? You kept me with you anyway. Forever in our Dark Room.”</p>

<p>This can’t be real.</p>

<p>“You’ve no power over me anymore.”</p>

<p>He leans in, and I feel a prickle in my neck. His breath on my ear sends a shudder down my spine.</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen, Max. Mr. Prescott wants you broken, and the man gets what he wants. We’ll see how you feel by the time I’m done.”</p>

<p>He undoes my restraints. I want to immediately jump on his throat, but my limbs refuse to obey beyond feeble twitching.</p>

<p>“Do you like my new cocktail? You’ll be just the right amount of conscious through it all. Aware, but helpless.”</p>

<p>He holds up my chin and stares into my eyes. Every fiber in my body wants to get away from this sick bastard. I can’t, and it’s driving me insane.</p>

<p>“Look at your pupils. That is perfect. You know, I didn’t get the chance to have fun with you the last time. It was all work and no play. We can fix that now.”</p>

<p>He takes my hands and brings them behind my head, and once more he tapes them together. As he leans close a repulsive sense of exposure and humiliation crawl inside my skull, drowning out rational thought. Fear rides alongside my breath as my heart hammers in my temples.</p>

<p>“Let me go, you freak...”</p>

<p>“Such a commanding argument, how could I refuse? But I must admit I’m impressed, Max. You’ve put up quite the fight, unlike your dear friend here. If you ask my opinion—and I know you’re dying to hear my opinion—she was hardly worth the dirt you walk on.”</p>

<p>In a drug-addled haze I notice Chloe is right in front of me, lying on the floor. There is a bullet hole in her forehead.</p>

<p>“Chloe...no, Chloe...I saved you. This isn’t real, I saved you.”</p>

<p>Her eyes flutter open. They are glassy and unfocused. She speaks without looking at anything in particular.</p>

<p>“You didn’t save anybody. You got my mom killed, Max. My whole home town. How fucked up is that?”</p>

<p>“What...?”</p>

<p>None of it is real. Stop listening, none of it is real.</p>

<p>“I asked you to save everyone. I would have done it myself, but the power was in your hands. Why would you turn it back? Do you really think I can live with this on my conscience? I might be breathing, but I am dead inside.”</p>

<p>I squeeze my eyes shut. It’s not real, it’s not real—I repeat it to myself, over and over. And yet I fight to break free, to move, to kick and thrash in any way I can. Paralysis holds fast all the same.</p>

<p>And then warm fingers brush into my hair, soft and careful. Their presence is a night-and-day contrast to Jefferson’s nauseating touch.</p>

<p>“Shhh.”</p>

<p>The hand holds my nape, cradles my head. Warmth and comfort trickle through the cold dark, like a beam of sunlight piercing the storm.</p>

<p>“Sleep, Max. Nothing will hurt you. You’re safe here.”</p>

<p>The whisper is quiet, gentle. It overtakes the accusing voices around me, firmly pushing them to the background. It lifts my thoughts above the roiling stormclouds.</p>

<p>“You’re safe here.”</p>

<p>I hold on to the words, lest I dive back into the maelstrom.</p>

<hr>
<p>My eyes open to a warm orange glow. There is a fruity, cherry-like scent in the air, and soft strings play on the stereo. Fingers gently comb through my hair, tender and soothing.</p>

<p>“Chloe?”</p>

<p>“Hey there.” She puts something down by the armrest—her phone, probably. I can easily hear a smile in her voice. “You were out a while. I was getting worried.”</p>

<p>My head is on her thigh. I’m holding on to her leg like it’s a teddy bear. A well-toned, bare leg, I can’t help but notice.</p>

<p>I don’t feel particularly inclined to move. “How long?”</p>

<p>“A couple hours. First you were out cold, but then you had some kind of nightmare. You calmed down after a while.”</p>

<p>“Was it you? Holding me, whispering?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Yeah, that was me. Not my first slumber party.”</p>

<p>I give her an appreciative squeeze. “Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Always.”</p>

<p>I realize it’s Message to Bears that’s on, some of their newer stuff. She must know I love it. And wherever that smell is coming from, it’s absolutely delightful. Scented candles, I guess? There is candlelight all around us, at any rate. It would all feel perfect if only the memory of the dream didn’t tarnish it so.</p>

<p>“It was horrible, Chloe.”</p>

<p>“Want to talk about it?”</p>

<p>“It was way worse than I’m used to. Did Sean Prescott really capture us?”</p>

<p>“You saw that?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Was it real? Watching you get tortured? Just tell me.”</p>

<p>“Not for me—I mean, <em>I </em>didn’t go through it. But it was real for BetaMax. She was able to escape after <em>weeks </em>with that madman. She went back through a picture and made sure it never happened.”</p>

<p>It’s stunning to hear her confirm it. What an awful thing to go through. I can still feel the hatred inside me, all that impotent rage. No wonder I’d wanted him dead.</p>

<p>“And Jefferson? He’s not around, is he?”</p>

<p>“No, that fucker is as dead as can be. A semi flew into the police station and crashed through his holding cell, only good thing to come out of that tornado.”</p>

<p>“He’s dead for real? They found his body?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what was left of it. I swear to you, he won’t hurt anyone ever again.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>I consider her words for a moment. “He deserved worse,” I tell her.</p>

<p>“My thoughts exactly. Max, what’s going on? You’re not supposed to keep any memories. It’s never happened before.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe dreams are...different? I’ve no idea how all this works.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember anything else? Anything at all?”</p>

<p>“No, I swear. Just that awful dream. Maybe there’ll be more. As if I needed more nightmare fuel...”</p>

<p>“That’s such bullshit. I was hoping you’d finally be able to sleep now, but I guess it was too much to ask for. It sucks to see you so tired all the time.”</p>

<p>“Aw, it can’t be that bad. Not if you’re there to rescue me from the boogiemen.”</p>

<p>“I wish. Sometimes there’s nothing I can do other than wake you up. You’ve told me to just leave you alone so at least <em>I</em> get some sleep, but obviously I’m not going to do that.”</p>

<p>I look at her through the corner of my eye. “You’ve been sitting here the whole time?”</p>

<p>“Nah. After I got you settled nice and comfortable I worked out and showered, then came to check on you. I did my Max Whisperer thing and then I, uh...I got a few other chores done. It’s safe to do things while you’re sleeping, since I know you won’t be rewinding it away. Been chillin’ here for the last twenty minutes or so. Sure feels nice to slow down.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, I’m sorry, but...you said you <em>worked out</em>? You?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, laugh it up, you nerd. We’ll see if you’re still laughing when I have to carry your limp ass out of trouble again because Little Miss Oracle is having another vision.”</p>

<p>“Mee-ow, talk about a touchy subject...”</p>

<p>“Not really.” She pinches my arm. “I just like giving you shit.”</p>

<p>“Never noticed at all. You know, I want to keep asking you about a million things, but I feel like such a moron, shooting a thousand questions per minute.”</p>

<p>“You kidding? This is nice. Usually I’m the one with chronic amnesia. I finally get to be the infuriating know-it-all.”</p>

<p>“Well, now you know how it feels to have to explain everything all the time, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, such heavy burdens we carry.” She sighs and rolls her shoulders, settling into the extra-plush cushions. “It’s a tough life, but we manage.”</p>

<p>We fall silent again, and I float adrift in the super cozy ambiance. Her fingers keep combing my hair, short fingernails tingling on my scalp now and then. Her other hand idly travels up and down my arm, grazing it, caressing, stroking back and forth, back and forth. It feels nice. <em>So </em>nice. I could definitely get used to this.</p>

<p>Man. If I’m perfectly honest, I’m feeling a bit...you know. In the mood? Slow music, candlelight, a whole lot of touching going on...it’s like custom-built to get me going, and I’m not made of stone.</p>

<p>My eyes snap open. I suddenly bolt upright, grinning like a maniac. “Oh my god, you’re totally trying to seduce me.”</p>

<p>It’s there for only a second, but there’s no mistaking the sudden panic in Chloe’s features.</p>

<p>“What! Get over yourself, you were having a nightmare. I just...I know what you like, and I wanted you to be comfortable when you woke up, and...”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“It’s true! This is basically a new life for you, I want you to feel like you belong here, so...”</p>

<p>“You’re <em>so</em> busted, Chloe, just admit it.” I glance down pointedly. “Nice short-shorts, by the way.”</p>

<p>“Hey, fuck you, okay? I try to do something nice for you and this is what I get.”</p>

<p>I tilt my head at her, completely unable to wipe the smirk off my face. A part of me knows this is kind of cruel, but watching her fidget is too damn amusing. Her cheeks fluster even more somehow.</p>

<p>“Fuck,” she says at last. “Am I that obvious?”</p>

<p>“Actually, you were really smooth. And it was working, too.”</p>

<p>“For real?” Her face brightens, but soon it transitions to a cringe. “Look at me, I said I wouldn’t be a creep and now I’m pawing at you while you’re sleeping. I don’t know how to handle this, okay? One moment you’re <em>super </em>into me, the next it’s like we’re back to square one. So I guess I figured...you know, if you <em>wanted </em>to make a move, why not make it real easy for you? I swear we don’t have to do anything, I know this is all—”</p>

<p>I close the distance, cup her jaw and press my mouth to hers. It might seem impulsive, but honestly I’ve wanted to do it since I showed up.</p>

<p>No, much farther back. In every day that passed. In every minute after our last kiss by the lighthouse. All this time I’ve been wreathed in the fire of that memory, I’ve roused it and fed it until it consumed my other life. Would I have jumped if we hadn’t kissed? Would I have missed her so if I hadn’t stolen a taste of what could’ve been?</p>

<p>Her response is...intense. After a tiny moment of surprise her arms slip around my waist and pull me in. Her lips lock and tangle with mine, avid and hungry. She’s breathing me in like there isn’t enough oxygen in the room.</p>

<p>I’ve done this twice. She has done it hundreds of times, and it shows. She knows my every tic and twitch. It’s weird and eerie and awesome.</p>

<p>Our mouths part, and we look at each other. There’s a wild flutter in my chest and such a sweet smile on her lips. “You’re so hardcore, Max.”</p>

<p>It’s painfully tempting to take this further, but I have to hold back. There are way too many questions in my head. I kiss her again briefly, just a peck and a smile, and then go back to resting on her lap. “Just letting you know for sure I’m really, really interested in what you have to offer.”</p>

<p>“Wow, um. Okay.” She’s a bit breathless. “Way to assert dominance, you cocktease.”</p>

<p>“Hah! That’s why I’m the boss, right?”</p>

<p>“I know you’re bullshitting, but you kind of <em>are </em>the boss. You’re often twenty steps ahead of everyone around you. It’s hard to argue with anything you say.”</p>

<p>“Doubt that ever stops you from trying.”</p>

<p>“Nope, sure doesn’t. You know me well.”</p>

<p>I want to stay in this moment. Let the conversation die and use her as my pillow forever, not give two shits about where we are, what we’re doing or what has happened. I guess technically I could stay, if I simply rewound this minute over and over. But then it would stop feeling special, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Doesn’t matter. The questions writhe in my thoughts, never far beneath the surface. The least I can do is face what I’ve done.</p>

<p>“So...you know what I have to ask about, right?”</p>

<p>She tenses for a moment. She knows.</p>

<p>I clasp her hand, hoping to make it a bit easier to talk about. “Did anyone survive?”</p>

<p>She breathes out slowly. “Yes. There were plenty of survivors.”</p>

<p><em>Just not my mother, </em>I hear within the ensuing silence. “I’m so sorry, Chloe.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be. We’ve been through this already.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean it as just...I’m sorry it had to be this way. I’m sorry we couldn’t have both.”</p>

<p>“I know you are.” She squeezes reassuringly. “Me too. But we have to look forward. I was a shitty daughter, I screwed up everything with her, but I can’t go back and change that. All I can do now is make her proud of who I become.”</p>

<p>I can tell this is another conversation we’ve already had. I wonder how long it took for grief to become acceptance.</p>

<p>“Don’t know if this helps,” I tell her, “but she was devastated to lose you. Inconsolable. It’s...part of the reason I—”</p>

<p>“David’s still around, by the way. And Queen Skank Victoria Chase, since she wasn’t even in Oregon at the time.”</p>

<p>Okay, I can take a hint. Shut up about Joyce. “That’s awesome. It’s great that David pulled through.”</p>

<p>“Blackwell was razed to the foundations, so he wouldn’t have made it if he hadn’t taken a day off after helping raid Jeffershit’s lair. And then he found out about my mom...but even then he was able to set it aside and throw himself into search and rescue. He’s a big damn hero, and I was a dumb-ass to never give him a chance.”</p>

<p>“And...we didn’t help?”</p>

<p>“We tried. I swear we tried. But we couldn’t handle it. We came down from that hill and I watched you break down kicking through debris, you just lost it. We had to get away, it was too much.”</p>

<p>“So we simply left?”</p>

<p>“For a while. Well, I mean, we haven’t officially gone back, but we’re <em>present.</em> Remember all the money you’re worth? You’ve thrown so much cash at Arcadia Bay that they might rename it the Max Caul-Field.” She has the audacity to wait for a beat. “Get it? Because, you know...flattened.”</p>

<p>“You are <em>the worst, </em>Chloe.”</p>

<p>“And yet I’m the company you keep. Not that they even know it’s you, anyway. We’re shady people, everything anonymous, through charities and fund raisers.”</p>

<p>“That sounds...complicated.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. You went full Groundhog Day and taught yourself a million things in record time. It was the weirdest thing, you’d wake up, hang out for like a minute, make these insane phone calls and suddenly you were exhausted again, asking me to do a few things while you slept as much as your fucked up nightmares would let you. Food would vanish from the fridge. You’d whisper in your sleep about routing numbers and penny stocks among all the usual bullshit. It felt like living with a ghost for three days.”</p>

<p>“Man, and I just overwrote all that knowledge, didn’t I? Way to go, Mean Max...”</p>

<p>“Will you stop with the self-flagellation already? <em>You </em>are the reason we’re here at all. Besides, you taught me a lot, I know all the passwords and you left yourself the cliff notes in the journal, so it’s not all lost. We knew this would happen, okay? We planned for it. Trust your loyal minion in this.”</p>

<p>“More like my babysitter, I think. Sounds like you’re constantly taking care of me.”</p>

<p>“It goes both ways, believe me. You know how it is. Great power...”</p>

<p>I sniff out a chuckle. “Great bullshit.”</p>

<p>“Yep. That’s why we decided to stay officially dead.”</p>

<p>It takes me a moment to process what she said. I sit up, frowning slightly. “We what?”</p>

<p>“We realized it was safest for everyone. You’re a target, and that makes everyone you ever knew a target.”</p>

<p>“For whom? Sean Prescott? I thought he knows who I am already, what difference...” I trail off. Alarm bells are going off in my head all at once. I grab her arm. “Chloe, are my parents okay?”</p>

<p>She gently pats my hand. “They’re okay, don’t worry. In <em>this </em>timeline, because you fixed it. Because we didn’t run to them. Do you understand what I’m saying?”</p>

<p>“They...they got hurt? Because of me?”</p>

<p>“No, because <em>Prescott. </em>But they are okay now. They know everything, actually. You took care of it.” She sighs, shaking her head. “I think it’s time I start at the beginning and tell you the whole story. Or I guess you could read the journal and be done with it, whatever you want.”</p>

<p>“Wait, they know everything? As in...<em>everything?</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes,</em> Max, they totally know you’re gay for me, though it pains me to see how distraught you are about it.”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean! They know?”</p>

<p>“That you bailed on your scholarship and you’re now a high school drop-out? Yep, that too.”</p>

<p>“Chloe.”</p>

<p>“Aaaand that you’re a time traveler, yes. You might have thoroughly convinced them of that as well.”</p>

<p>I sit there in dismay, trying to imagine poor mom and dad learning that their daughter is now a super-powered vagrant. I can see every hope and dream they had for me vanish from their eyes. Dad’s laughter turning to concern, to disbelief, to held-back tears. Mom would get annoyed first, then be horrified. She’d weep ‘til her eyes gave out.</p>

<p>And then the realization turns inwards. <em>I </em>had imagined moving back home with Chloe for a while. I’d imagined coping together with our loss, figuring out our lives, finish my studies, become a photographer. And most of all, I’d imagined myself scarred enough never to touch these disastrous powers again.</p>

<p>Chloe delicately wraps an arm around my shoulders, as if afraid I might collapse under the weight. “You’re finally getting it, aren’t you? There is no normal life for us, Max. And you know what? Good riddance. Do you really want to worry about rent payments and career struggles, get us some degrees and enter the rat race? You are a <em>time traveler. </em>Even more than that, what you can do is crazy, some real superhero stuff. You can’t possibly throw that away just so you can go back to a quaint little hipster life.”</p>

<p>“Chloe, I fucked up <em>everything </em>using these powers.”</p>

<p>“So? More of a reason to try harder, to use them <em>right</em>. You got so wrapped up in my problems back then that you never stopped to think about the big picture. You can change the world, Super Max.”</p>

<p>I snort out an incredulous laugh. “Right, or blow it up to pieces! You’ve been drinking far too much Kool-Aid.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it when I see the impossible happen every day. You’ll come around, I’m not worried. So anyway, what will it be? Journal or storytime?”</p>

<p>“Oh, um. I’d rather hear your voice, if you don’t mind one way or another. I’ll still read the journal later.”</p>

<p>“Fine by me. Let me go for a smoke break and we’ll start. Take some time to look around, I know you’re dying to poke your nose into every file and drawer.”</p>

<p>“That’s outrageous. Are you calling me nosey?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m calling you a shameless snoop. I’ll be right back.” She leans in and kisses my lips like it’s a matter of course, then half-way to her feet realizes what she just did. She looks back at me like she just got in trouble with the principal. “Shit, I’m sorry, I didn’t even think about it.”</p>

<p>I blink at her, pressing my mouth to a thin line. “Way to take me for granted, Chloe. You’re getting comfortable way too fast.”</p>

<p>“I seriously didn’t mean to, it just happened! I’m really sorry, I used to do it all the time!”</p>

<p>It takes everything in me to keep a straight face at her sudden panic. I might be a bit of a sadist.</p>

<p>“You will kiss me only when I give you express permission.” I point at the floor. “Now bow before your Mistress.”</p>

<p>Her eyes widen. Her jaw drops. It’s <em>priceless.</em> “You’re such a brat!” She shoves me back into the cushions, grabs her phone and beany from the armrest and stomps off to the sound of my laughter. “This is what I get for giving a shit...” The front door swooshes open and closed.</p>

<p>I can’t help myself. I know terrible things have happened, and we’re embroiled in all sorts of dangerous crap, but...there is this deep-seated joy inside of me, filling me with hope and excitement. I did something monstrous to be here, something monstrous that I don’t regret. For the first time in months, I feel happy again.</p>

<p>Does that make me a monster?</p>

<p>“It just makes you fucked up in the head,” I say to the empty space in front of me.</p>

<p>I look around in the candle-lit darkness. The clock on the microwave says it’s one in the afternoon—those are some seriously effective blinds and tinted windows. I notice my coat and gun holster on the chair next to the couch I’m on, and chuckle at the mental image of Chloe struggling to take the thing off me while I’m passed out. The reminder that I’ve actually shot people is quite sobering, though.</p>

<p>Without much thought I stretch over and drag the coat closer, ready to dig through its pockets. It’s hardly snooping when I’m rifling through my own belongings.</p>

<p>One empty plastic baggie. One switched-off phone. One magnetic-band security keycard; <em>Prism, </em>the logo reads under a stylized cube outline. One pack of sugar-free gum, strawberry. One fancy-looking taser, holy mother of god. And in an inside pocket, the same ratty old velcro wallet I’ve had since my thirteenth birthday. The velcro doesn’t even stick anymore, but I will forever cherish all the slots and now-broken zippers and side compartments, so compact yet useful.</p>

<p>I pry it open and I’m greeted by a photo of Chloe. She’s sleeping, blue hair all over her face, mouth slightly open, one cheek pushed up a bit by the pillow. It’s adorable and sincere and perfect. Inside its usual slot is my driver’s license, but it’s totally different. It’s an Oregon license, for one, and in the picture I have long-ish dark hair and...lipstick? Ew. I look at the name, do a double-take, roll my eyes and facepalm.</p>

<p>Apparently my official name is Lauren Frost now. That’s the name of my level eighty-five undead mage. A...<em>pretty cool </em>name, you could say.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s final. You are an irredeemable nerd, Max.”</p>

<p>Nothing else seems to have changed. Fifteen dollars in cash—I thought we were rich now?—and I even kept my Blackwell student ID tucked all the way in the back. A painful dash of nostalgia, I suppose.</p>

<p>I pocket my wallet and power on the phone, terribly curious about my message history. Uh...actually, no thanks. Fuck you and your four-digit pin, have a nice day.</p>

<p>I put the phone back and get up, gaze wandering about. Chloe’s taking a while. I’d go find her but I could do without the smell of smoke. Might as well occupy my mind with something, right? Wonder what kind of food we have. I shuffle into the kitchen area and start opening random cupboards.</p>

<p>“Ooo, cookies.”</p>

<p>I dig into the box and fish out a few. Chewy chocolate biscuit with coconut flake frosting, yum. Munching away I head deeper into the belly of the beast, my sock-clad steps all on their own drawing closer to the giant bed beyond the open doorway. There is a laptop on the counter, but nah, It would take too long to boot up and poke through—I mean, it might be Chloe’s and I respect her privacy. Yes.</p>

<p>Walking into the bedroom, the reflection on the standing mirror is the weirdest reality check. Skin-tight, long-sleeve black shirt with matching slacks. Fingerless gloves, badass as all hell if you ask me—and I can perfectly envision Chloe painting this dark shade of blue on my nails. And a shiny golden mane down to shoulder-length, finger-combed every which way. It seems weird as fuck to my eyes. Sure hope the dye washes off like she promised.</p>

<p>I look so...small. Gaunt, even. Am I developing an eating disorder? Better eat another one of these cookies for the greater good.</p>

<p>I use the convenient hair tie on my wrist to redo my ponytail while I survey the room. A wall-spanning closet, dressers and lamps on either side of the bed and a tiny chair-and-desk with another laptop on it. A beautiful Spanish guitar hangs by the window, easy to reach. The bed is neatly made and super fancy, round mattress and everything. There’s an adorable eyepatch-clad teddy bear on it with a striking resemblance to the Captain. And ah, yes, finally. There’s my Chloe, empty beer bottles and clothes scattered on the floor, somewhat hidden by the right side of the bed. I get the feeling this won’t be nearly as endearing after months of living together.</p>

<p>I open the top drawer of my own dresser. Hair clasps and ties, mints, tissues, guitar picks, gummy bears, a watch.</p>

<p>“Ooo, pictures.”</p>

<p>A selfie of us in front of the Seattle skyline at dusk, somewhat smiling—we look just like I remember us in this one. Chloe in some park somewhere, red-faced at the top of a chin-up. A shot from behind of Chloe on this very bed, on her stomach, using her laptop. Her hair, wet and combed straight, is a blue cascade on her neck and shoulders. It looks freshly dyed. And oh, she’s only wearing her panties.</p>

<p>I speak strictly as an artist when I say that the contour of her shoulder-blades draws enticing shadows on her skin. I’m convinced this is the only reason why I took the photo.</p>

<p>I put them away and open the second drawer. A massive binder takes up the whole space, barely leaving room for a few pens and colored markers. Upon its black surface two words are written in silver: <em>Selfie Archive</em>.</p>

<p>“There’s no way I’ve been working on a portfolio on top of everything that’s going on.”</p>

<p>It weights a good ten pounds. I haul it onto the bed, sit next to it and lift the cover. Each page is thin white cardboard with a five-by-five grid of plastic sleeves, and each slot contains a selfie of some description—sometimes both of us, sometimes just me. Every photo has the time and date scribbled on its white frame: they start at the end of October and it’s mostly one per day, some time during the evening hours. With very few exceptions they are utterly joyless and uninspired, like they were taken as part of some kind of routine.</p>

<p>I pick one at random and slide it out of its sleeve. My handwriting is on the back: <em>Before going to bed. </em>I try a few others with the exact same result, then search for one with daylight. December 14<sup>th</sup>. Chloe is mid eye-roll in this one. <em>Before retrieving fake IDs.</em></p>

<p>Okay. Awesome.</p>

<p>I flip to the last one, a bit past the half-full mark. It’s the photo I jumped through today, dated March 7<sup>th</sup>, 9:35 AM. Chloe wrote on this one, big bold letters that take up nearly the whole frame: <em>Before saying goodbye.</em></p>

<p>“Poor Chloe...”</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ve ever pranked her with this. One of these days I’ll pretend to be from the future after taking a picture, and tell her to do laundry and dishes or the whole place will catch fire while we sleep. <em>Don’t argue with me, Chloe! It’s the only way!</em></p>

<p>I can’t decide whether it would be funny or just totally messed up. Probably both.</p>

<p>Energetic strides subtly rock the RV, and I sense more than hear Chloe’s approach. “Max?”</p>

<p>“In here.”</p>

<p>There is a pause in the steps. The music goes quiet, then changes into some other band I don’t recognize; it starts coming out of speakers inside the room somewhere. I like how it starts, mellow strings and female vocals, rich and soulful. Glass bottles clink together out there, which I guess means Chloe opened the fridge. There are two distinct thuds one after the other and then the burbles of pouring liquid, after which the fridge door closes again.</p>

<p>The tempo picks up, percussion coming in short bursts of depth. Wonder if she’s playing it for my benefit, I’m falling in love here.</p>

<p>Huh. It’s a weird thought. I probably have new favorite bands that I don’t know yet. I didn’t exactly keep up with new music during my five months of emo heartache.</p>

<p>Her head pokes through the doorway, black hair down to her collarbones under the blue beany. She seems greatly amused. “Yep. I didn’t for a moment expect you to stay put when there are mystery drawers to get into.”</p>

<p>I show her my last cookie. “You were holding out on me, so I had to take matters into my own hands.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” She’s carrying an open beer bottle in one hand, a glass full of purple in the other. She leaves the glass on what is obviously my dresser. “Grape juice for the tight-ass,” she says.</p>

<p>“Thanks, mom.”</p>

<p>Chloe bounces onto the bed and sits with crossed legs next to me and the album. “A productive snooping session, I see.”</p>

<p>“And a lengthy one, too. You took a while.”</p>

<p>“I chill for a bit, too. And munch on a mint, because Princess Maxine Hemsworth the Third doth protest about the smell.” She smiles impishly. “And the taste.”</p>

<p>“Really? It never bothered me that much. It’s all part of the tats and ‘tude package.”</p>

<p>“Mm-hmm, say that again after months of living together. I’m quitting, anyway. Down to two a day.”</p>

<p>“Wow. Just for me? I’ve got you so whipped.”</p>

<p>“Bite me, Caulfield. I started smoking to piss off my mom and David. Now I feel like a jerk every time I light up.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Foot, meet mouth. “That’s, uh...I was just teasing, sorry.”</p>

<p>“And also I’m whipped, yeah, whatever, I’m not ashamed. You were in it just as deep, you know? Give it time,” she says while wiggling her pinky, “I’ll have you wrapped around my finger soon enough.”</p>

<p>She seems to consider her own words, blinking repeatedly. “That...came out way dirtier than I meant it.”</p>

<p>I simply look at her while searching for an appropriate way to respond. How <em>does</em> anyone respond to what she just said? We are probably the first couple in history to be in this situation.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that right now I find myself terribly distracted by her proximity. She’s so damn gorgeous, sitting there in her shorts and flimsy shirt and cute hat. When did this start happening to me? We slept in the same bed before and I didn’t think twice about it. It’s like all this talk of romance has made me hyper-aware of her physicality.</p>

<p>“So whatever the hell is this?” I ask while gesturing at the binder. Deflect and move on, good strategy.</p>

<p>Chloe smiles like she knows exactly what’s going through my head. “You can’t guess?”</p>

<p>“Well, yeah. The fucking Necronomicon, in my hands.”</p>

<p>She laughs. “Dude, you’re so dramatic. Just let me tell you the whole story, otherwise we’ll keep going back and forth with questions forever. Not that it would bother me, since you’re rewinding all of it.”</p>

<p>“What? Why?”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait, let me set up the marker.” She stretches over to the teddy bear and props it up so it sits on her nightstand. “There. Did you rewind yet?”</p>

<p>“Uh, no?”</p>

<p>“Alright, cool. So, watch First Mate Bongo when rewinding and stop the moment he moves. Don’t go any further, okay? You even got a fifteen minute buffer of me smoking in case you overshoot, because I plan ahead like that.”</p>

<p>“Jeez, why do you want me to rewind this so bad? Is the story that awful?”</p>

<p>“No, dummy. Well, it <em>is </em>pretty bad, but that’s not the reason. We need to test your powers to see if anything’s changed, and we’re gonna have to rewind over <em>something, </em>so...away goes the infodump.”</p>

<p>“But that means you won’t remember any of this. You’re okay with that? It feels so...wrong.”</p>

<p>Chloe shrugs. “You’ve always struggled with that way more than me. It literally makes no difference from my point of view. If anything it makes me feel bad for you, always so guilty about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s like stealing your memories! I remember doing it so casually to everybody when all this started. ‘Ha-ha, let’s see how she’ll react if I say something else.’ I shouldn’t have been like that, I feel gross thinking about it now.”</p>

<p>“Not sayin’ your heart is in the wrong place or anything, just...you know, it’s no big deal if it happens.” She tilts her head toward the teddy bear and smiles. “That’s why First Mate Bongo is here to help you, ‘cause I’d love to keep that badass kiss on the couch. To put it in words you’ll understand, it was <em>hella </em>amazeballs<em>.”</em></p>

<p>My laugh is so sudden that it comes out with a dorky snort. Eh, who cares. “I’ll do my best, I promise.”</p>

<p>“Alright, all formalities out of the way, let’s get this story rolling.” She takes a swig of her beer. “So what’s the last thing you remember? Top of the cliff, reality throwing a fit as we yell feelings at each other?”</p>

<p>The memory is usually enough to bring a wet sting to my eyes, but the way she puts it makes me chuckle instead. “Yeah, pretty much. You gave me the butterfly picture and you said...you told me it was the only way.”</p>

<p>“Okay. That’s when you pull out your journal and show me. Weirdest moment of my life.”</p>

<p>Chloe wriggles up the bed and leans back against the headboard. She pats the pillow next to her.</p>

<p>“You might want to get comfortable. This will take a while.”</p>
