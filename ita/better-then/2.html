    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="chapter-text">
      <p>In this moment, the wind whips at my face while the shoreline rushes up to meet me. As I drop one thought screams in my head: I’m about to die. This is the stupidest idea I ever had, how did I get this desperate? Too late to regret it now, isn’t it, genius?</p>

      <p>A terrified wail starts in my throat as the cliff flies up closer and closer, painting vivid images of a mangled body bouncing down all the way to the rocks below. I spread my hands in front of me as if they’d be enough to break the fall.</p>

      <p>One moment later, I am back atop the lighthouse.</p>

      <p>I stumble a bit, holding on to the rail for dear life. One faltering breath, two, and then I collapse in a weeping mess.</p>

      <p>I nearly killed myself. But it worked, but I nearly killed myself, but it worked. I keep going back and forth between the thoughts, horrified and proud at the same time. It takes me a while to put myself back together.</p>

      <p>Eventually I take a deep breath and groan to my feet. I can feel it in there again, that otherworldly well of potential, of reality-warping power. It’s back within reach. I look at my right hand, searching for differences. There is nothing that I can see.</p>

      <p>I look back up, and there is a blue butterfly on the railing, sitting exactly where I jumped from. It lazily flaps its wings, by all accounts uncaring of what I might do.</p>

      <p>“Don’t know if you’re a guardian angel or a troll spirit, but...thanks, I guess.”</p>

      <p>It flutters away, probably off to make a tornado somewhere else. With some hesitation I reach out and try to rewind. Reality itself thickens around me, prickling my senses in familiar ways. There’s the pressure, the reluctance, the compliance. It’s oddly comforting.</p>

      <p>While wind and leaves reverse direction, the butterfly continues floating away.</p>

      <p>I let go. “Figures.”</p>

      <p>The power is back, it really is all back. Has it been in me all along? Or is it this weird spirit, watching over me, giving and taking away on a whim?</p>

      <p>It’s all the same one way or another, isn’t it? I got what I wanted. There is only one thing left to do now.</p>

      <p>With quivering fingers I pull out the photo again. Its edges are worn and the white border has yellowed some, but the picture is still as clear as the first day. I hold it with both hands so it won’t shake as much.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, everyone. I wasn’t strong enough.”</p>

      <p>I focus my senses. Its contours shimmer. Everything but the picture blurs away.</p>

      <p>Let this reality be no more.</p>

      <p>Move the cart. Grab the hammer. Smash the glass. Trigger the alarm. Everything the way it was.</p>

      <p>I’m a nervous wreck as I listen to Chloe surviving the encounter. How much blood is on my hands right now? It isn’t like before: I know what will happen this time. I am actively, intentionally destroying the town for purely selfish reasons.</p>

      <p> “It’s well worth the Price, Max.”</p>

      <p>I can’t even hold back the smile. Am I a horrible person?</p>

      <p>Leave everything the way it was—except one detail.</p>

      <p>I pull out my journal and leaf forward. Will ten pages do? I forget how much I wrote before the final day. It doesn’t really matter, as long as I see it a couple days from now. If I don’t leave a note for my future past self, I will be stuck in a never-ending loop of misery.</p>

      <p>I pencil it lightly so it won’t leave a noticeable mark through the paper. The words take up a whole page.</p>

      <p>Hi, Max. I’m Max from the future.</p>

      <p>She will ask you to go back to the Blackwell bathroom.</p>

      <p>Don’t do it. Just move forward.</p>

      <p>Show her this note when it happens, but not before.</p>

      <p>Seriously, I’ll be pissed if you let her die again.</p>

      <p>I feel my senses losing grip by the time I get to the end. I put the journal back where it belongs and my hand over the big red button as if I just pressed it. Hopefully my past self will do everything she’s supposed to do from here on out.</p>

      <p>A blanket of white shrouds my vision.</p>

      <p>In one moment there is a bathroom around me while a fire alarm hammers my eardrums.</p>

      <p>In the next moment, I’m standing in a small nondescript room with a computer terminal and a door straight ahead. There is a weapon in my hand. A taser?</p>

      <p>“I swear,” a familiar voice chimes in my head, “you’re the most badass superhero ever.”</p>

      <p>I look down, and there is a still-twitching man on the floor. Two more lie behind me.</p>

      <p>“Hello? Earth to McFly, why are you just standing there? Shit, did the feed freeze again?”</p>

      <p>“Chloe?”</p>

      <p>“Whoa, hey. You said not to use our names in the field anymore, least you could do is stick to your own rules.”</p>

      <p>I bring a hand to my ear and find some kind of earpiece. “What, uh...what should I call you?”</p>

      <p>There is only silence for a moment.</p>

      <p>“Are you okay?” she finally asks. “This really isn’t the time to fuck around.”</p>

      <p>“I...I just, um...”</p>

      <p>The joy of hearing Chloe’s voice is somewhat dampened by all the bodies around me. I obviously just tased them. Nothing worse than that, hopefully.</p>

      <p>“Dude, snap out of it.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, uh, okay.”</p>

      <p>“What is going on with you?”</p>

      <p>“Alright, so...don’t freak out, but I’ve told you what I can do with pictures, right? You know?”</p>

      <p>“Oh for fuck’s sake, right now? Are you serious? How far back?”</p>

      <p>“Wh-what?”</p>

      <p>“You just used a photo to make this timeline. How far back did you go?”</p>

      <p>“I...f-five months. Why is there—”</p>

      <p>“Five...”</p>

      <p>Another stretch of silence.</p>

      <p>“Holy shit,” she finally breathes. “you’re Mean Max. It finally happened.”</p>

      <p>“I, uh...”</p>

      <p>“It happened...shit, it happened. This is the worst timing ever...”</p>

      <p>“Why am I holding a taser, Chloe? Where am I?”</p>

      <p>“No time right now.” Chloe’s voice has become strangled, like she’s holding back tears. “Please do exactly as I say. Look in your coat inside pocket, left side. You’ll find a photo of us there.”</p>

      <p>I start doing as I’m told, but something under my coat stops me in my tracks. Aghast I stare at the shoulder holster strapped to my chest.</p>

      <p>“I’m carrying a gun?”</p>

      <p>“There is no time for this, Max. Do what I’m telling you, chit-chat later.”</p>

      <p>“Fine, sorry, okay.” I dig in the inside pocket. The photo is right there, all by itself inside a ziplock bag. We are staring into the lens, serious and businesslike. I barely recognize either of us.</p>

      <p>“That’s an hour ago,” she says. My god, why is she crying? “Jump through, and tell me this word for word: It’s time to say goodbye. I’ll know what to do. Do you understand?”</p>

      <p>“Y-yeah. Yes. Are you alright?”</p>

      <p>“I’m fine. Just do it, Max. You’re in danger right now. I love you, okay?”</p>

      <p>“Uh—”</p>

      <p>There’s loud clattering noise on the other side, and buzzing and scratching from the microphone. Her voice can still be heard, distant and muffled. “Fuck. Fuck!” Loud crashing sounds. Things breaking. “Now she shows up? Why the fuck now? Fuck! God fucking dammit!”</p>

      <p>She keeps swearing. She keeps yelling and crying.</p>

      <p>What the hell kind of reality is this?</p>

      <p>I stare into the photo. Just do what she says for now, it seems to be literally life or death. I try my best to concentrate past the weapons and the bodies and Chloe’s explosive rage.</p>

      <p>My senses blur with astonishing ease, and once more I’m gone.</p>

      <p>The camera flash goes off, and I blink for a moment, disoriented. I look to my left, and a raven-haired Chloe is quizzically staring at me.</p>

      <p>“Aw crap,” she says. “You used the photo. I thought for sure the plan was good. What happened?”</p>

      <p>I try to get my bearings. We’re inside a car, compact, sleek-looking interior. I’m dressed in black from toes to fingerless gloves, and so is she.</p>

      <p>“Chloe...”</p>

      <p>“That bad, huh? Wait, how long did you go? Please don’t tell me it’s been days. Oh god, are you okay?” Her hand squeezes mine as she leans forward, looking closer. There is so much concern in her eyes...</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I’m fine, I...it’s not what you think.” I cover her fingers with my free hand. “You told me to tell you this: ‘It’s time to say goodbye.’ You said you’d know what to do.”</p>

      <p>Her expression, it just...drops. She shrinks away, looking at me like I sprung a horrible tragedy onto her lap.</p>

      <p>“No. No way. How long? How long from now?”</p>

      <p>“Um...an hour, you said.”</p>

      <p>She takes it in silence, leaning back on the seat, just breathing for a while. I look at the picture on my lap. It’s so weird to see myself with golden blonde hair, tight ponytail, loose strands tucked behind my ears. Chloe’s hair is done up in a wispy bun with side-swept bangs, black as can be. She now has a nose stud, apparently. We both look so tired.</p>

      <p>“Alright,” she whispers. “Okay. Alright.” She blinks and rubs at her eyes. She looks at me and tries to smile through the welling tears. “You’ve got the worst timing.”</p>

      <p>I smile back, apologetic. “So I’m told.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah? How angry was I?”</p>

      <p> “You...you were furious. I think you started trashing the place, wherever it was.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. I can relate.”</p>

      <p>“You called me...Mean Max?”</p>

      <p>Chloe waves her hand dismissively. “Just our nickname for the other you, it’s not mean-spirited. Look, it’s gonna be tough and weird, but first of all...thank you so much for what you did. The note you left.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, uh...sure, I guess? It’s been a long time for you, but I just did that.”</p>

      <p>“I know, yeah.” She blows out a frustrated breath, shaking her head. “Holy shitballs, this just got complicated again. Goddamn time travel.”</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, Chloe, but...can I please hug you? I’m just so happy to see you.”</p>

      <p>Even in her state of shock I can see a playful twinkle light up in her eye. She stretches an inviting arm. “Babe, we’ve done far more than that, so knock yourself out.”</p>

      <p>I gloss over what she obviously means and go to her without hesitation. It’s awkward to bend over the handbrake, but the hug is still everything I want it to be. I squeeze her against me as hard as I can, and I can feel the reality of her existence sink into my bones.</p>

      <p>It was worth it. Whatever happens, whatever I’ve done...it was worth it.</p>

      <p>“You’ve been dead for five months where I come from,” I say close to her ear.</p>

      <p>“That’s what we thought. We figured you’d show up eventually. Didn’t think it would be this long.”</p>

      <p>I let go reluctantly. “Why...why were you so mad?”</p>

      <p>“D’uh. I didn’t get to say goodbye to BetaMax. I’ve always known it would happen, but that doesn’t make it any easier. But hey, this Chloe right here gets a whole hour, so...it’s all good.”</p>

      <p>“BetaMax?”</p>

      <p>“Cuz she’d be obsolete eventually, get it? It’s kinda mean, but it stuck.”</p>

      <p>“Oh.”</p>

      <p>I hadn’t thought about it, of course. I had never given much consideration to the Max I overwrote each time I traveled into a new reality through a photo.</p>

      <p>This Max...she had known what would eventually happen, thanks to the message. What would it be like to live for months knowing that at some point everything you’re experiencing will be forgotten in an instant?</p>

      <p>It was a death sentence, in a way.</p>

      <p>“Chloe, why am I carrying a gun?”</p>

      <p>“Explain later. You’re about to go, anyway.”</p>

      <p>Right on cue, the edges of my perception start fraying. I grab her hand, suddenly afraid to let her go into yet another uncertain future. Or...present, technically.</p>

      <p>She smiles at me. “See you on the other side.”</p>

      <p>“Chloe, I’m sorry. Tell her I’m sorry.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t be. You saved me again and she knows it. She’ll only be mad about the timing.”</p>

      <p>“Still...”</p>

      <p>“Chin up, soldier. We’ll get through it, okay? And hey, don’t worry about the dye jobs. They wash off.”</p>

      <p>It’s the last thing I hear before a world of white swallows me whole.</p>
