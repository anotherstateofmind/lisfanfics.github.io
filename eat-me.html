    <p>When Chloe says "eat me" to Max after they break into the principal's office, Max does.</p>

    <p>“Eat me,” is the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="risposta a tono">deadpan retort</span> Chloe throws Max’s way before she plopped down in the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="lussuosa, soffice">plush</span> chair behind the desk. As soon as she <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="spinge in avanti">scoots forward</span>, she begins <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="frugare">pilfering</span> through the stacks of papers, the drawers, the computer; anything she can touch is looked over before being put back in its place.</p>

    <p>Max sucked in a breath, face growing hot at the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sboccata, volgare">foul mouthed</span> reply her best friend gave her. It wasn’t the first time she’s heard Chloe say such a thing, and it was of the tamer barbed <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="battute">quips</span> the blue haired girl often surprised her with. But the sudden images that flooded her mind made her halt in her tracks, preventing her from coming up with <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="anche solo la minima risposta">even the faintest of replies</span>.</p>

    <p>“Kidding,” Chloe laughed, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="inclinandosi, piegandosi">leaning</span> back into the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="pelle imbottita">padded leather</span> of the chair as she watched Max shift <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="da un piede all'altro">from foot to foot</span> <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="davanti a lei">before her</span>, embarrassed and <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="agitata, confusa">flustered</span> by the ambiguity of her words. It’s cute and only caused her laughter to increase. Even in the dark of the room, she can see the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="rossore">blush</span> that <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ricopre">coats</span> Max's face.</p>

    <p>"I doubt you would even know what to do." She sang the words, giving the chair a <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="giro">twirl</span> before giving Max one of her famous <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ghigno beffardo">shit eating grins</span>. "Come on, Max. Stop standing around and help me look for clues."</p>

    <p>Max remained silent, chewing on her lip before she took a tentative step forward, then another, slowly making her way around the desk to stand in front of Chloe. Desire sparked deep within her belly (along with a healthy dose of provocation), guiding her actions as she finally stopped to stand in front of her friend.</p>

    <p>Lately Max has found herself speechless when in Chloe's presence. As if she had cotton in her mouth after looking into the girl's obscenely blue eyes, stealing her voice and courage. She had often questioned herself on whether she was attracted to the other girl, but with all the bizarre stuff going on in Arcadia Bay, she decided to push that question off until later. But still, that persistent <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sentore">inkling</span> of "what if" sat at the back of her mind.</p>

    <p>But actions are better than words, and it's with little care for the consequences for the moment that she leans forward, giving Chloe a gentle <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="bacetto">peck</span> on the lips. Fingers <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="distese">splay out</span>, trembling against Chloe's thighs as Max sinks down to her knees between the taller girl's legs. The kiss breaks as soon as Max finds herself fully seated on her knees.</p>

    <p>Chloe inhaled sharply, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sobbalzando">jerking</span> back in the chair, fingers gripping the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="braccioli">armrests</span> <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="più che può">for dear life</span> as she absorbs what just happened. Mind swimming in confusion, she barely registered that the brunette was resting her head against her knee. Unconsciously, she <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ha stretto">squeezed</span> her legs shut around the other girl's head, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="avvicinando">drawing</span> Max's face closer and trapping her in place for the moment.</p>

    <p>"Max," She whispered the name, able to <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="uscire dai">snap out of</span> her own thoughts for a moment. Still, she couldn't stop the fearful, uncertain waiver her voice took on. "What---?"</p>

    <p>"I---" Max states, mouth once again dry and voice odd on her tongue. She shifted <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="appena appena">ever so slightly</span>, pushing Chloe's legs onto her shoulders. "I've never done this before, so I---"</p>

    <p>Chloe's fingers, warm and strong, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="si infilano">thread</span> through her hair, pulling her face up as the taller girl twists and bends to lean down and kiss Max properly this time.</p>

    <p>It's all teeth and tongue, too much, too sloppy, and probably one of the worst kisses either of them had received in their lives. But even with <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="saliva">drool</span> leaking down from their chins and the awkward position both were in, Max and Chloe were happy.</p>

    <p>When the kiss finally breaks, they both pull back, twin smiles on their faces as they butt their foreheads together, noses bumping and rubbing against the other's.</p>

    <p>"So I guess Warren doesn't have a chance anymore?" Chloe teased, earning a gentle <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="manata">swat</span> to the thigh from Max. She laughed at the gentle hit, giving Max one more kiss before leaning back in the chair once more.</p>

    <p>"I've been trying to <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="togliermelo di dosso">shake him</span> for a while now. I've given hints and turned down his dates, but the boy is persistent," Max sighed, going back to resting against Chloe's leg.</p>

    <p>Fingers <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="tracciano, camminano">trail</span> up and down the taller girl's thigh, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="[i buchi degli strappi sui jeans]">catching at a hole</span> every now and then, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sfiorando, toccando">grazing</span> over exposed skin. Each brush of her fingers sends Chloe's hips <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ruotare">gyrating</span> upwards and it causes Max stomach to do the most marvelous of <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="salto mortale, capriola">somersaults</span>. It's <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="inebriante">intoxicating</span> to know that even simple, almost innocent, touches can cause Chloe to lose her composure.</p>

    <p>She can hear Chloe's sharp intakes of breath each time she drags her fingers over skin. Looking up, her heart stopped dead in her chest as she looks at Chloe, pupils dilated, lip <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="stretto, serrato">clenched</span> between her teeth as she held back her desire.</p>

    <p>Dragging her nails down Chloe's clothed thighs, Max <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sussulta, treme, freme">shuddered</span> as she watched her friend <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="agitarsi, contrarsi, fremere">twitch</span> and <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="gemere">groan</span> at the action. In mere seconds Max is <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="mordicchiando">nipping</span> at the fabric of the taller girl's jeans, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="godendosi, divertendosi">reveling</span> in the obscene way Chloe throws her legs open to give her more access.</p>

    <p>Her fingers are back in Max's hair, unsure on <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="tirarla, portarla">tugging her</span> forward or pushing her away. But once the brunette starts mouthing at the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="cavallo">crotch</span> of her jeans all thoughts of stopping died on her tongue.</p>

    <p>"Max," Chloe <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sibila">hissed</span> through clenched teeth. A needy whine left the blue haired girl's throat before she <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="freneticamente">frantically</span> began <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="strattonare">tugging at</span> her belt, the button, and zipper of her jeans. She needed Max's mouth on her, to calm the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="violento, scatenato">raging</span> desire coursing through her. But that persistent mouth catches a finger, sucking on the digit before giving a little bite, flooding her with a new wave of want.</p>

    <p>"Oh God...." Chloe groaned, throwing her head back as she <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="struscia contro">ground against</span> her friend's face. She's ready to say fuck it and tear her damn pants off if Max didn't hurry.</p>

    <p>"Let me."</p>

    <p>Max took her time, however, removing Chloe's belt, making sure to <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="prolungare">draw out</span> the process while leaving soft bites and kisses against her thighs and the crotch of her jeans. By the time she started unbuttoning Chloe's pants, the girl was a <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="agitarsi">squirm</span>ing mess.</p>

    <p>Kicking off her boots and wriggling out of the binding fabric of her jeans once she heard the satisfying sound of the zipper being pulled, Chloe felt a <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ondata, impennata">surge</span> of self-consciousness as she sat there, legs splayed open with only the thin fabric of her <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="slip">panties</span> covering her from Max's <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="indiscreti">prying</span> eyes.</p>

    <p>Sure, Max had seen her naked before, but they weren't kids anymore. This was a whole different type of exposure and she felt a <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="fremito, ondata">flutter</span> of uncertainty in her <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="stomaco">gut</span>.</p>

    <p>Max, ever the empath, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ha subito colto">picked up on it right away</span> and leaned up to <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="reggere, tenere, cullare">cradle</span> Chloe's face in her hands, kissing her once more. There was no rush this time, no invasion of tongue and spit, but a slow, sensual kiss that seemed to <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="calmare">settle</span> Chloe's <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="spossati">frazzled</span> nerves.</p>

    <p><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="vaganti">Wandering</span> fingers brushed over the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="umido">damp</span> fabric of Chloe's underwear, rubbing her sex through the cloth as she continued the kiss.</p>

    <p>Chloe <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sospira">sighed</span> into her friend's mouth, letting her anxiety <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="si dissolva">melt away</span> as Max <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="fa scivolare">slipped</span> her hand past the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="'cintura'">waistband</span> of her panties. The sigh turned into a <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="gemito">moan</span> as the brunette began rubbing her clit in slow circles, letting Chloe's thrusting hips dictate her speed and pressure.</p>

    <p>It blew her mind to know her best friend was currently getting her off in the middle of the night in the principle's office. But Max just held her, kissed her, made her feel good for the first time since Rachel had left.</p>

    <p>Breaking the kiss, Chloe let out a soft sob as pleasure raced down her spine at her building climax. Everything in that moment was centered around Max. Her scent, her touch, it was all hers, and Chloe just <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="tiene stretta">clutched</span> her close, riding out her pleasure against her best friend's hand.</p>

    <p>As the last tendrils of pleasure washed over her, Chloe <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sprofonda">sagged</span> against the chair, shivering slightly as Max removed her hand from her underwear.</p>

    <p>"Max, that was... Incredible," Chloe said, head <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="che ancora le gira">still swimming</span> from what just happened. A soft <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="risolino">chuckle</span> escaped her as she just leaned forward, kissing the brunette once more.</p>

    <p>Even after the intense orgasm she just experienced, Chloe still responded sympathetically to the brunette's touches, and helped lift her hips as she felt the shorter girl <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="tirare">tug at</span> the waistband of her underwear, pulling them down and off. Discarded somewhere along with her pants and boots.</p>

    <p>"I'm glad <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="che le tende non si intonino al tappeto">the curtains don't match the drapes</span>," Max laughed as she was greeted by a neatly trimmed thatch of light blonde pubic hair.</p>

    <p>Chloe snorted, shaking her head at the off-putting joke. "Yeah, well, it burns the fuck out of your <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="pacco, genitali">junk</span>."</p>

    <p>Max merely squinted at that, the question on if Chloe ever actually tried to dye the hair covering her sex sitting on the tip of her tongue.</p>

    <p>"I read it in a magazine, Max," Chloe said with a roll of her eyes.</p>

    <p>The brunette <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="alza le spalle, fa spallucce">shrugged</span>. "I wasn't asking."</p>

    <p>"You were totally going to though." Even after all the years apart, Chloe could read her like an open book.</p>

    <p>Another blush <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="cresce, si insinua">crept up</span> around Max's neck and face at the accurate accusation.</p>

    <p>"Ah! You were!" Chloe laughed, her current state of undress currently forgotten as she teased her friend.</p>

    <p>Max <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sbuffa">huffed</span> at the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="scherno">taunt</span>s, before <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="far scorrere">sliding</span> her hands up to <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="afferrare">grip</span> Chloe's hips, scooting forward until she was able to bury her face between the taller girl's legs. Oh, she could definitely find a way to silence that smart mouth of Chloe's. Or at least get her to stop making teasing remarks.</p>

    <p>"N-not fair," Chloe moaned as she felt the first gentle stroke of a broad tongue against her clit. "That's totally cheating..."</p>

    <p>But all other protests fell away as Max <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="bagna">laved</span> and <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="profonde/riempie di attenzioni">lavished attention on</span> that small bundle of nerves, causing Chloe to hump frantically against her face. Fingers <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="aggrovigliate">tangled</span> in thick brown <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ciocche">locks</span>, holding Max firmly in place.</p>

    <p>Soft whines and gentle <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="suppliche">pleas</span> fell from Chloe's lips, a melody unlike any other to Max, and it only encouraged the smaller girl to keep going. Salt and <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="sapore acre">tang</span> exploded on her tongue as she thrust her tongue deep within her friend's sex, one hand gently rubbing at the swollen point of Chloe's clit. All that mattered was how far she could thrust her tongue, what made Chloe twitch, what made her <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="agitarsi, contorcersi">writhe</span> beneath her touch.</p>

    <p>Max's name quickly filled the air as Chloe clutched her friend's head tightly within <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="la sua stretta">her grasp</span> and legs. While she wasn't a virgin, Chloe didn't have this connection with past lovers like she did with her best friend. It felt... well, right.</p>

    <p>Disentangling her hands from messy brown hair, she raked her nails across her clothed breasts, lightly pinching her nipples through the fabric of her shirt. It wasn't long before she started reaching that peak once more, and it was with a choked cry of Max's name that she <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="[careen: sbandare]">careened</span> over the edge, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="inondata">awash</span> with pleasure.</p>

    <p>A splash of liquid coated Max's chin as Chloe reached her end, and it was with a few more languid strokes of her tongue that Max sat back, lips and tongue <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="intorpidite">numb</span> from what just happened.</p>

    <p>"Max, that was...." Chloe <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="dice ansimando">panted</span>, arms <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ciondolano">flopping</span> <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="senza energia">listlessly</span> to her sides. A tired, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="soddisfatto">sated</span> smile spread across her face. "That was incredible."</p>

    <p>A spark of happiness burned bright within Max's chest at the praise. She was glad to have taken the initiative now.</p>

    <p>"Anytime, Chloe," Max whispered as she stood up and stretched.</p>

    <p>She could feel blue eyes scanning over her, watching her with curiosity.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I didn't say we were done yet, Super Max."</p>

    <p>A <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="risolino">giggle</span> broke free as she was once more tugged to the floor, only for Chloe to quickly join her beneath the desk.</p>

    <p>Evidence could wait. The world could wait. Right now they needed one another in a way only carnal appetites could <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="saziare">sate</span>.</p>

    <p>Everything as alright for the moment.</p>
